A custom Frequntly Bought Together I created for out product pages, allowing customers to see what other customers purchase along side our products.
Features include
  - Variant switching, which will also change the price, title and photo of that product
  - Allows for customers to untick or tick products they may or may not want
  - Total price and total saving price (plus how much is being saved together)
  - If one product goes out of stock, another secondary product will show up, allow customers to have many options
  - Fully functional on desktop and mobile
    
  - Not really a feature for customers but within Shopify, i managed to create custom tracking, to show how sucessful the FBT is

Work in Progress features
  - Giving customers higher discounts for more FBT products bought
