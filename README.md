I created a custom Frequently Bought Together for our product pages, allowing customers to see what other customers purchase alongside our products.
Features include
  - Variant switching, which will also change the price, title, and photo of that product
  - Allows customers to untick or tick products they may or may not want
  - Total price and total saving price (plus how much is being saved together)
  - If one product goes out of stock, another secondary product will show up, allowing customers to have many options
  - Fully functional on desktop and mobile
    
  - Not a feature for customers but within Shopify, I managed to create custom tracking, to show how successful the FBT is

Work in Progress features
  - Giving customers higher discounts for more FBT products bought
